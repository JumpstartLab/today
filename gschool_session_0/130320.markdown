## Testing a Rails Application


* Clone this [specialized version of the Blogger project](https://github.com/gSchool/rails-testing)

Several specs have been written for this Rails application. However, the majority have been left as pending. During the workshop we will review the completed specs and work towards completing the remaining specs.

### Model Testing

It is tempting to start testing the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) functionality of an ActiveRecord (AR) model. These are methods that you in the past poured blood, sweat, and tears into conceptualizing and creating. It is time to that go and test the important functionality that you layer on top of those models.

* Test [Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html)
  * Presence of `Article#title` and `Article#body`
  * Presence of `Comment#author` and `Comment#body`
  * `Author#password` matches `Author#password_confirmation`
* Test Instance Methods
  * `Article#tag_list` and `Article#tag_list=`

### Controller Testing

When developers start testing Rails they often overlook the Controllers. Hoping that if they make the Controller "skinny" enough it will save them from having to do much work. That or developers often rely on larger, feature tests to check for the correct output.

* Test that the correct template was rendered
* Test that the correct instance variables have been assigned
* Test that the valid items are saved to the database
* Test that the invalid items are not saved to the database
* Test that an item is deleted
