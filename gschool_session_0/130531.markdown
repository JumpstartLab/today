## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

#### Individual Project

* Now that you've been working on your own for a week, how does it match up with your expectations? If you thought it'd be super hard, was it? If you thought you'd move incredibly quickly, did you?
* Given that you've defined an MVP and are almost halfway through, do you feel like you've gotten half of the work done? If not, do you expect progress to speed up? Why?
* Working on your own, do you feel like you're spending more time stuck on problems or are you more likely to ask for help?

#### The Future

* It's seven weeks until we're finished. What do you intend to focus on during that time? Why is that the most important thing?
* During this last phase of the class, you're taking on more and more responsibility for your own learning, development, and future. What people, knowledge, and resources are you cultivating to continue your growth?
* Coming into the program you had an idea of what success looked like. Is it within reach? Or has your goal changed along the way?
