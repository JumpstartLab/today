## Daily Outline

* Warm-Up
* SalesEngine

## Warm-Up

Pull down the latest warmup from the repo and complete it by 9:15

## SalesEngine Final Push

If you haven't yet run your SalesEngine against the spec harness, you should do that as soon as possible. It will require you to "gemify" your SalesEngine.

### Data Update

Katrina will publish a new dataset this morning for use with the tests tomorrow. If your code was correct with the old dataset, you should have no problems. But there may have been some bugs that the data wasn't highlighting that the new data will uncover.

### Remember Coverage and Style

http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php

No matter the state of your code base, you're better off delivering half a product than a half-assed product.

Make sure you're checking and improving your test coverage with SimpleCov.

Use the `Cane` gem to audit line length and some other issues:

{% terminal %}
gem install cane
cane --style-glob 'lib/**/*.rb'
{% endterminal %}

You can ignore the "Class definitions require explanatory comments on preceding line:" warnings.

Use the `Reek` gem to search for methods that are long:

{% terminal %}
gem install reek
reek . 2>&1 | grep "(LongMethod)"
{% endterminal %}

If you want really harsh criticism, you can run reek and get all the warnings:

{% terminal %}
reek .
{% endterminal %}

### Support

Frank and Jeff are available most of the day. Katrina will be here for only the AM. Please make use of the flow as much as possible.

## Lightning Talk Check-Ins

Lightning talkers for this week need to meet with Jeff in the "Overlook" conference room near the instructor desks at 4:00pm.
