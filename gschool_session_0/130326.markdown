## Structured Pairing

This afternoon let's practice our pairing.

### Protocol

Today, let's use a protocol we're calling "Ping-Pong on Rails". Assume that P1 starts as the first name listed in your pair and P2 the second name.

1. Start with passing tests
2. Together, write a request spec using Capybara (ex: user adds an item to the cart). Run it to see it fail.
3. P1 writes a supporting controller spec and sees it fail.
4. P2 either (A) makes the controller spec pass *without adding code to any model* or (B) writes a model spec
5. If P2 wrote a model spec, then P1 writes the implementation. After implementing P1 writes the next model spec or controller spec. Go to step 4.
7. Flip roles (P1 and P2), then return to step 3
