## Daily Outline

* Warm-Up
* Project: SalesEngine Work Time
* Project: SalesEngine Check-Ins
* Meetings: Early 1-on-1s
* Lightning Talk: Draft Reviews

## Warm-Up

At 8:50 we will post a new warm-up. `git pull --rebase upstream master` to get the code.

If git complains that you have `unstaged changes`, then do the following:

{% terminal %}
$ git stash save
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
$ git stash pop
{% endterminal %}

If git complains that it doesn't know about any remote named `upstream`, then do the following:

{% terminal %}
$ git remote -v
{% endterminal %}

If there are only two entries called `origin`, and those point to the JumpstartLab warmup-exercises repository, then you can call:

{% terminal %}
$ git pull --rebase origin master
{% endterminal %}

For any other git complaints speak up, and we'll debug together.
