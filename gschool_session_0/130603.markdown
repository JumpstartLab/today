## Work Time

### Individual Project

Hopefully you made a lot of progress over the weekend. Your goal for today should be reaching "feature complete" and have tomorrow & Wednesday to iron out UX, design, and edge cases.

Good luck!

### Young Americans Project

Today is demo day for your work with the YA Entrepreneurs. Is it great? Take a bit of time today to put the finishing touches on the site itself and the hand-off instructions for your students.

## Reading Group

At 3pm today we'll have an activity focused on the first six chapters of Paul Dix's "Service-Oriented Design with Ruby on Rails".

### Groups

* Logan Sears & Erin Drummond & Laura Steadman
* Phil Battos & Jorge Tellez & Christopher Knight
* Bradley Sheehan & Josh Mejia & Kyle Suss
* Geoffrey Schorkopf & Chelsea Komlo & Danny Garcia
* Elaine Tai & Blair Anderson & John Maddux
* Aimee Maher & Raphael Weiner & Daniel Mee
* Shane Rogers & Kareem Grant & Paul Blackwell & Jennifer Eliuk

### Plan

* Gather in your small groups and grab a whiteboard
* Work on the following activity until 3:40
* Discuss the questions with your group
* Gather back in the classroom with photos or text of your results

### Challenge

Have you heard of this little app called Blogger? Well, we think it's going big time.

If you were building a fully featured multi-user blogging platform, how could you break it down into services? It's up to you to determine the features that the platform would offer. Think about the different kinds of content posted by both authors and visitors, possible integrations, etc.

* What would each service do?
* What data would need to come in and out of each?
* How would they communicate?
* What would be the sequence of events when...
  * An author posts a new blog article
  * A reader posts a new comment

### Discuss

* What's better about this architecture than just building a single app?
* What's worse? Beyond just being "complicated", what parts of your normal workflow are more complicated?
* What would be the choke points in your design keeping it from scaling to a billion users?

## Lightning Talk Kickoff

This week we'll have five lightning talks from:

## YA Project Demos

This evening we'll have a little party to celebrate the work done with the YA entrepreneurs. 

### Logistics

Please plan to...

* Help setup 4:15-4:45
* Have your project ready to demo
* Attend from 5:00-6:30

### Content

Make sure that you know what you're going to say and show off. We'll have three mics, one for the student and two for you. They've been asked to prep the following:

1. Your name, age, business name, business description.
2. Why they wanted a web application for their business
3. How the web application will help their business
4. Something they learned from this experience.
5. Where the guests can buy the studentâ€™s products (web address)

The demos should take around or less than 5 minutes total. Consider showing off both the front and back end. What will it look like for the kids to maintain over time? What was interesting about the business, the implementation, etc?
