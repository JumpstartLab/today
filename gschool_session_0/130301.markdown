* Retrospective

* Guest: Ryan Smith (?)
* 1-on-1s

## Retrospective

It's important to look back and assess what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, celebrate victories, and analyze defeats.

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of today (9:00-9:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* Your Progress
  * We're officially one month in. How are you feeling?
  * How has your relationship to your peers matched or contrasted with your expectations? Do you think that will change at all during the remaining five months?
  * Monday we'll conduct our first individual skills evaluation. How do you think it'll go? What will be your strengths and weaknesses?
  * Make a "resolution" for the next month -- what are you going to focus on doing better?
* TrafficSpy
  * Is working in a web context more exciting than our command-line applications?
  * What's more challenging/confusing?
  * How could things be simplified? AKA, do any of the components/technologies seem unnecessarily complicated?
  * What practices/techniques are benefitting you so far? Which feel like they're slowing you down?
  * Is testing getting easier as you gain practice, or harder as the projects get more complex?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.

* What was the most confusing thing you worked on or learned this week?
* What was your least favorite class session this week? Favorite?
* Do you feel like you're able to apply lessons from Eloquent Ruby in your programming?
* How are you going to "recover" from SalesEngine?

## Personal Study

Use the time this afternoon to recouperate through learning. Please remember to **respect the Friday** and put your project away.

### New Ideas

* Continue reading Eloquent Ruby. See if you can apply lessons learned to some of our warmup exercises, even if it's overkill.
* Begin reading HTML & CSS.
* Install Ruby 2.0 via RVM. 
  * Run some of your old code, like SalesEngine or warmups. Do things work as expected? Faster/slower?
  * Experiment with some of the new features explained in https://speakerdeck.com/shyouhei/whats-new-in-ruby-2-dot-0 and http://globaldev.co.uk/2012/11/ruby-2-0-0-preview-features/
* Read about and practice writing Rake tasks: http://jasonseifer.com/2010/04/06/rake-tutorial
  * Experimenting with writing a rake task to automate some part of your system or workflow. Could you write a rake task that deletes files in your `Downloads` folder that are older than 15 days?
* Use RSpec to review your Ruby with TestFirst.org: http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby

### Old Ideas

* Work through the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
* Try out [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) for automatically running your tests on file change.
* Start experimenting with the JavaScript lessons on http://www.codecademy.com/
