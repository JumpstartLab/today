## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of this session (9:00-9:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* FeedEngine - What are you building? Does it feel like it could be a legit product that people want to use?
* Teamwork - You've been through the project wringer a few times now. What strategies are you using to help your team work effectively? How are they going so far? Is there anything different about how you approach a three-week team versus a two-week team?
* Jobs - If you're looking for a job after gSchool, what are some of the attributes that are most important to you about a company / position / team? How will you know when you've found the right fit?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.

* What systems is your team using for organization?
* How do you feel about having more vague project requirements? And different from other teams?
* What are the big unknowns between now and delivering your project?
* What are you excited / worried about as we ramp up the job-placement process?
* Any questions for me?
* Shout-outs?

## Open Source

This afternoon we have a very short window for open source work. I'd like you first prep for Jose's session, then work on whatever OSS-related thing you like.

### Elixir Prep

* Read http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html
* Get Erlang installed along with Elixir, ensure that the tests pass
* Work through the small snippets on that getting started page
* Continue working through the [Diving In](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/2.html) and other sections as you have time
