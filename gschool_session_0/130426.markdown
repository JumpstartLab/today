## Retrospective

It's important to look back and assess what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, celebrate victories, and analyze defeats.

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of today (9:00-9:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* What have you chosen to do differently for this iteration of the project?

* What are some of the challenges working with yet another existing codebase?

* What are some of the differences working more closely with a client in developing features?

* Do you find you prefer a more agile approach or a waterfall approach? why?

* What are areas within the Rails stack do you feel you have strong understanding? What areas do you feel you have weak understanding? How are you leveraging/improving these skills in your current project?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.

## Open Source

It was great that last week we got some open source work started. Let's keep it going this week.

Set a goal for yourself of **submitting a pull request today**, regardless of how small. If you need some help, consider reaching out to your own mentor or the mentors that are hanginging out in the Flowdock room.
