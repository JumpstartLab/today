## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Spend 35 minutes writing a blog post reflecting on some of the questions below:

#### Services Project

* How's it feel to be back in a group? Did you learn any lessons working on your own that you're now bringing through the group?
* Do you feel like you're understanding the concept of services? What makes sense and what's still confusing?
* Have you dug into using websockets with Faye? How has it gone so far?

#### Job Hunt

* How's the job hunt going? Have you applied for jobs? Interviewed? Any lessons learned?
* What are your next steps to finding a great job?
* What things have you observed, from shadowing or guest speakers, that appeal to you about companies? What things have turned you off?
