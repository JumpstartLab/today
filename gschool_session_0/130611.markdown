## Getting Started with Vagrant

When you're not doing the assessment today, you will experiment with using Vagrant, Linux, Capistrano, and related tools.

This is going to very frustrating, unclear, confusing, and difficult. Just FYI :)

You're encouraged to work in pairs or groups, but each person should setup their own machine.

### Goal

By the end of the morning session, your goal is to:

* Have a working Linux instance featuring:
  * Apache or NGINX as a front-end web server
  * Unicorn, Puma, or Thin as the Rack application server
  * PostgreSQL
  * Redis
  * Ruby 2.0
  * Your application
* Have a runnable Capistrano script that:
  * runs from your primary Mac OS
  * deploys an app to the Linux instance
  * runs any pending migrations
  * restarts any servers as necessary
