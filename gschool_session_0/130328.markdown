### When You're Not Meeting

During your work time we'd like to see you:

* Talk with your group about the pairing experiences yesterday. Were there any techniques or ideas that can come back to your project?
* Make sure that your Tracker project is an accurate assessment of your progress. Are you hitting milestones? Do your next iterations need to be shorter, longer, smaller, or larger? Solve any issues before your instructor check-in.
* Spend at least two hours in active pairing with your group
