## Daily Outline

* Warm-Up
* Feature Testing Gotchas
* Interview: Joesph Wilk
* Lightning Talks

## Feature Testing

Frank will cover some settings to make you successful when writing your feature tests.

* Why feature Tests?

* Using Capybara and Webdriver in Blogger to test:

    * Login
    * User creation
    * User deletion

## Interview: [Joesph Wilk](http://blog.josephwilk.net/)

* Feature testing with [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/).

Joesph Wilk is one of the core contributors on the Cucumber project and runs a integrated test service called [Limited Red](http://www.limited-red.com/).

## Structured Pairing

This morning and afternoon let's practice our pairing.

### Protocol

Today, let's use a protocol we're calling "Ping-Pong on Rails". Assume that P1 starts as the first name listed in your pair and P2 the second name.

1. Start with passing tests
2. Together, write a request spec using Capybara (ex: user adds an item to the cart). Run it to see it fail.
3. P1 writes a supporting controller spec and sees it fail.
4. P2 either (A) makes the controller spec pass *without adding code to any model* or (B) writes a model spec
5. If P2 wrote a model spec, then P1 writes the implementation. After implementing P1 writes the next model spec or controller spec. Go to step 4.
7. Flip roles (P1 and P2), then return to step 3

### Pairs

* Bradley & Kareem
* Phil & Blair
* Josh & Danny
* Logan & John
* Elaine & Laura

### Session 1 - 1:15-2:05

During the first session, your pair should work on the **first** person's project in the pair.

### Session 2 - 2:15-3:05

During the second session, your pair should work on the **second** person's project in the pair.
