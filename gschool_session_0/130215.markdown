## Daily Outline

* Retrospective
* Lightning Talks
* Guest Speaker: Keavy McMinn
* Open Source Work
* Meetings: 1-on-1s

## Retrospective

It's important to look back and assess what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, celebrate victories, and analyze defeats.

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of today (9:00-9:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* SalesEngine
  * What's a technique that you've used in the project that was once totally opaque but now is clear?
  * What's something that's still confusing to you? Why?
  * How do you feel about testing with MiniTest? What about it makes your process harder? Easier?
  * Is working in a pair harder or easier than being by yourself? Do you feel like you'd be farther ahead or behind if you were on your own? Can nine women make a baby in one month?
* Becoming a Developer
  * It's been a long three weeks. Do you feel like a developer yet?
  * You have 21 weeks to go. What are you most excited about?
  * How has the class environment matched or differed from your expectations?
  * What resources are you relying on when you need support, and why?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.

* What's the best thing about working in a pair? Worst?
* What was the most interesting thing you learned this week?
* What was your favorite class session or feature? Least favorite?
* Do you feel like you're ready for 1-to-1 mentoring? Why or why not?
* If you had to pair on a project for two months with Jeff, Katrina, Steve, or Frank, who would you pick and why?
* What are you looking forward to about next week?

## Afternoon Work

You're still a little ways away from contributing to open source projects. During this afternoon, please "respect the Friday" and do *not* work on your project. You should, instead, choose one or more of the following:

### Customize Your Environment

Head back to the [class session from Wednesday](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/sessions/gschool0/130213.html) and go down to the "Environment, Editor, and Tooling" section. Experiment with the techniques there to:

* Customize your terminal prompt
* Create shortcuts for your common operations (especially getting to your projects directory)
* Tweak built-in SublimeText settings
* Install PackageControl
* Install at least one extra plugin to Sublime and experiment with it
* Practice using at least three hotkeys you weren't familiar with before.

Don't let yourself get lured into SalesEngine. If you want to work with some code to practice techniques or try tools, use a warmup from this week that you didn't finish.

### Practice New Tools

* Try out [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) for automatically running your tests on file change.
* Play with [the terminal-notifier library](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) to send yourself OS X notifications. Look at the `Ruby/spec` to see examples.
* Experiment with [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) if you haven't already (use a warmup!)
* Use RVM to install JRuby and see if your warmups run the same as they do under MRI (normal Ruby). How does the speed compare? You might use the unix tool [time](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_time.htm). If you're far along in SalesEngine, it's ok to use it here but only for timing experiments.
* Start experimenting with the JavaScript lessons on http://www.codecademy.com/
