## Daily Outline

* Warm-Up
* Class: Rspec Syntax
* Class: Rspec - Mocks and Stubs Oh My!
* Reading Group: RG2 for Eloquent Ruby
* Lightning Talks Assigned - Group 4

## Warm-Up

Pull down the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository at 10:00 for today's exercise.

## Rspec

* Installing the RSpec Gem
* Installing Guard-RSpec
* RSpec Syntax: `describe`, `context`, `it`, and `expect`

### Fruit Stand

* Git clone RSpec Workshop - [Fruit Stand](https://github.com/burtlo/fruit-stand)
* Start Guard
* Fix Broken Specs
* Write missing Specs

### Additional RSpec Syntax

* Using `before` in nested contexts
* Using `let`, `subject`, and `described_class`
* Refactor the existing tests to make them more succinct

### New Feature - Ripe and Unripe

* An apple is ripe 10 seconds after it is initialized.
* Write a test that acurrately tests the new methods `Apple#unripe?` and `Apple#ripe?`.
* Remember to consider both situations when the fruit is unripe and ripe.

### RSpec's Stub Syntax

* Using `stub`, `with`, and `and_return`

### New Feature - Size

Not all apples are created equal. Apples are created actually created with a
random size from 5 slices to 9 slices.

* Create a new specification to capture this new feature.
* Update your existing specifications so that they still reliably work.

### RSpec's Mock Syntax

* Using `should_receive`, `with`, and `and_return`

### New Feature - Weather Service

Actually the randomness in apple size is determined by the response from the
`Fruit::Weather.report(:apples)` which will return the correct size for the
apple. IT is necessary that when an apple is created that it checks with
the weather service to determine its size.

* Create a new specification to capture this new feature.
* Update your existing specifications so that they still reliably work.

## Reading Group
