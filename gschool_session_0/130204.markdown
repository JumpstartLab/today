## Ruby Objects and Classes

Ruby is an Object-Oriented programming language. Let's look back at the EventManager project and refactor our solutions to use a more object-oriented approach, using it to explore Ruby object style.

### Reviewing EventManager

Let's quickly remind ourselves of what EventManager actually does by reading our existing source code.

### Writing Good Object-Oriented Software with SOLID

The key principles of good OO design are rolled up into the acronym SOLID ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))):

* *S*ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): Every object should have one and only one responsibility
* *O*pen/Closed Principle (OCP): Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* *L*iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
* *I*nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
* *D*ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend upon abstractions, not upon concrete understandings.

For today, let's focus on SRP. While the actual definition is focused on a class or object, SRP can be usefully applied at many levels:

* An application should do one and only one thing
* A class should do one and only one thing
* A method should do one and only one thing
* A line of code should do one and only one thing
 
Let's review EventManager and try to break up the functionality into classes, methods, and lines that follow SRP. Areas to attack include:

* Cutting out an `Attendee` class
* Using `PhoneNumber` to encapsulate functionality and validation
* Doing the same with a `Zipcode` class
* Encapsulating the Sunlight API lookups and processing

## Introduction to Lightning Talks

Every week we'll have a set of six lightning talks.

#### This Week - "Productivity"

This week we'll start with Group A presenting on the theme of *Productivity*. What's a technique or tool that can help your classmates been more efficient developers or humans? Make sure it's something they don't all already know!

*Wednesday* you need to bring your thesis/outline for review at 3:30pm with Jeff.

*Thursday* you need to bring draft slides/supports for review at 3:30pm with Jeff.

*Friday* you'll present from 10AM-11AM.
