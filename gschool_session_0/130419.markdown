## Open Source

It was great that last week we got some open source work started. Let's keep it going this week.

Set a goal for yourself of **submitting a pull request today**, regardless of how small. If you need some help, consider reaching out to your own mentor or the mentors that are hanginging out in the Flowdock room.

## 1-on-1s

Because of the double guest speakers, 1-on-1s will be very compressed today, about 8 minutes each. If possible, please queue near your room while the previous person is talking.

## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 20 minutes of this session (3:20-3:40), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* Son of Store Engine -- what went right? What went wrong? Why? What things will you do the same on your next project and what will you do differently?
* Organization -- how are you keeping track of what you need to do on a given day? How do you decide to divide time between project work, reading, lightning talks, and personal learning?
* Halfway -- As of today we're halfway done. How does that make you feel? What do you think the next three months will be like? Do you feel like your momentum is building or slowing? What can you do to affect your outcomes in July?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.
