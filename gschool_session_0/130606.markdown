### Peer Evaluations

## 1:00 - Demo Setup

We need to prepare the two external conference rooms for your presentations.

## 2:00 - Public Demos

All *approved* projects will each give a 5 minute demo.

* Spend about 2 minutes going through the user-side
* Spend about 2 minutes going through the backend and pointing out what's interesting
* Spend the last minute answering questions

## 3:30 - Demo Teardown

Please help cleanup the room once we're done demoing.
