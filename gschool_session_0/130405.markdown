## Open Source / Focus Time

During your study time today, please choose one of the following options.

### Focus Time with Katrina

Meet with Katrina in the main classroom to quickly iterate over small problems in the style of warmups or code retreat.

### Open Source

Explore and/or contribute to an open source project. Some of ours that might be worth exploring:

* https://github.com/burtlo/parade
* https://github.com/burtlo/metro
* https://github.com/jcasimir/locale_setter

If you're up for writing it'd be awesome to have your contributions to the curriculum repository (https://github.com/jumpstartlab/curriculum), which might take the shape of:

* Revising the content of existing tutorials
* Writing a walk-through of a warmup
* Starting to tackle one of the "Issues" (https://github.com/jumpstartlab/curriculum/issues?state=open)
* Adding an iteration to an existing tutorial
* Revising one of the project descriptions we've already completed for clarity, adding/removing requirements, etc

### Personal Learning

This will be the last week that self-directed study is going to be a real option during this time. Friday is about _community_, and it's a little too easy to zone out when just studying something on your own.

#### New Ideas

* Use Vagrant to build a virtual machine for running Rails applications: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant
* Setup and configure the Apache web server on your laptop (using guides [like this one](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/an-introduction-to-apache/)) to serve Rails applications. Experiment with URL rewriting. Can you mount your app such that the root URL has a prefix like "http://localhost:82/myapp/"?
* Install and experiment with the [Pow web server](http://pow.cx/)

## Retrospective

It's important to look back and assess what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, celebrate victories, and analyze defeats.

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of this session (2:00-2:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* What did you learn about Rails during StoreEngine? How does that shape your plan for the next project?
* What did you learn about working in a larger team during StoreEngine? What things will you do the same or different during the next project?
* Do you feel like your team was 50-100% more productive than a two-person team? How does that inform your thinking about the way teams are constructed?
* Did "Don't Make Me Think" influence decisions as your were building your app? Why or why not? When other people used your application, what did you notice?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.

* What strategies will you personally try to improve or emphasize during the next project?
* How did your work schedule work out? Was it worth it?
* Our next project will build on these projects. Would you want to build on your own code? Why/Why not? What attributes will you look for in a project to build upon?
* Who in your team would you give a shout-out to? Why? Outside your team?

## Lightning Talks
