## Focus on Collections

This morning let's split our time between a lecture/conversation and accompanying workshop.

For the first half, pull up the tutorial: [Focus on Collections]({% page_url topics/collections %})

After that, let's jump into the workshop here: *todo*

## Event Reporter

Your first project will be [EventReporter]({% page_url projects/event_reporter %}).

You can start now and the project is due at *11AM on Thursday, February 7th*. This is a very compressed timeline for the project, so work quickly.

This is an *individual project*, but you're welcome to ask each other questions and collaborate. Use your gut instinct to tell the difference between helping someone and doing their work for them. Remember that the struggle and learning are really more important that the end product.

## Office Hours

Every week we'll have Office Hours from 2-7pm where we encourage engineers to join us, in person and online, to help answer your questions, review your code, etc. Please remember that they're doing it out of kindness not responsibility. But, at the same time, they're participating because they want to answer questions, not sit around doing their email. Seek them out and get support!
