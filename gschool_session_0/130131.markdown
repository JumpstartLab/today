### Demo Accounts

Each team has a demo account. Please sign out of your personal account in your web browser to avoid spamming your so-called friends.

Account credentials will be posted on the whiteboard.

### Work Pattern

Your pair should create a single program that represents equal effort from each half. We suggest you:

* Pick one person's machine to be "primary"
* Start a join.me session on that machine
* Connect to that session from the other person's machine
* On the primary machine, allow the second person to control the mouse/keyboard
* Have one person do the typing, and the other person tell them what to type
* Use pomodoros, and each session flip-flop responsibilities
* Feel free to work in either classroom or anywhere else in the building

The most obvious way to arrange yourselves, physically, is side-by-side. But some pairs like to sit across the table from each other, machines back-to-back or offset, so the programmers can easily see each other.

### Support

If you need support during your project, use the following process:

1. Hammer on it with your pair for at least 15 minutes
2. If that didn't work, ask a another pair for help/advice
3. If that didn't work, ask a second pair for help/advice
4. If none of that works, ask Jeff & Frank

### Submission

Submit your completed project as a single `.rb` file by attaching it to an email sent to submission@jumpstartlab.com by 8:30AM on Monday, February 4th.

Within the file include a comment at the top in this format:

```ruby

Where you fill in your own names and completion date.

### Evaluation

This project will be evaluated by your peers on Monday morning. The emphasis will be on proper functionality, but they'll also subjectively evaluate code style/aesthetics.
