### Peer Evaluations

Be sure to split the time to allow evaluations of each other project and code.
I strongly encourage you to run through your script for your public demonstration
for practice and ellicit feedback from each other.

## 1:00 - Demo Setup

We need to prepare the two external conference rooms for your presentations.

## 2:00 - Public Demos

All projects will each give a five minute demo of their project.

* Focus on the interface and functionality
* What's interesting about your project?
* What are the little details that make it pleasant to use?

* Who has what role for the demo? (Who's running the computer, who's talking, who's standing there awkwardly)
* What order are you going to do things? (We start at the products listing, then...)
* What are the key points that you want the audience to takeaway?

Each presentation will be on a timer and Frank and Steve will start clapping you off stage when it ends.
