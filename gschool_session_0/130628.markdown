## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Spend 35 minutes writing a blog post reflecting on some of the questions below:

* There are 3 weeks left of the program. What is a programming concept, technique, or technology that feel like you must learn before you finish?
* You've been in the process of searching for a job for a while now, and some of you have accepted offers. How do you feel that the hunt is going? What do you think you might do differently when you look for your next job a couple of years down the road?
  ** If things are going slowly, what do you think is causing that? Can you do something differently?
  ** Has the entire interview process been fun?
  ** If you've been busy and have had a number of interviews, how has this changed your perspective on the process?
  ** If you've accepted an offer, how are you feeling about it?
* Demos are coming up. What are your expectations for these demos? What do you want to get out of them? Are you on track to do so?
