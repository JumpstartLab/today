## Assessment

### Preparation

You can find the assessment assignment at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/scrabble.html

Before your session you **should**:

* Setup [the driver for display link](http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php) so we can use the pairing monitors
* Read the assignment
* Clone the repo: https://github.com/gSchool/scrabble
* Run `bundler` to install dependencies
* Get to your room a few minutes early
* Make sure you mind is in the right state to show off your capabilities

Before your session you **should not**:

* Begin working on the assignment
* Discuss how to implement the assignment

### Encoding and Filtering Data

First, let's learn about strategies for filtering the data provided by an API. Work through the following tutorials and exercises first:

[Encoding & Filtering JSON APIs]({% page_url topics/web_services/encoding_and_filtering %})

We've just worked on some updates for this tutorial. If you hit snags, pull requests are very much appreciated.

### Blogger API & Gem

Last week you learned about how to provide APIs from Rails ([APIs & JSON]({% page_url topics/web_services/apis_and_json %}), [Exposing an API]({% page_url topics/web_services/api %})) and how to build a wrapper library. Let's put those techniques to work:

1. Clone the Blogger project
2. Add reading API endpoints to..
  * Get a list of the `title`, `id`, and `URL` for all articles in the system
  * Retrieve the `title`, `body`, and `comments` (as a nested collection with the commentor name and text) of a specified article
3. Add writing API endpoints to...
  * Post an article
  * Post a comment to an article
4. Create a wrapper library to make the below interaction work:

{% irb %}
> blogger = Blogger.new('http://localhost:3000')
> existing_articles = blogger.articles
> new_post = blogger.create_article(:title => "API Sample Article", :body => "With quality content like this, you don't need photos.")
> blogger.articles.count - existing_articles.count
# => 1
> new_post.comments.count
# => 0
> new_post.create_comment(:name => "Mickey Mouse", :body => "Oooooh Tooooodles!")
> new_post.comments.count
# => 1
> new_post.comments.last.body == "Oooooh Tooooodles!"
# => true
{% endirb %}

## Reading Group: POODR

Let's do some practice around imperative versus object-oriented programming. 

### Exercise

* Get together with your pair listed below
* Use TDD to guide your progress
* [Step back to our very first warm-up exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/01-99-bottles)
* Implement a solution that uses no methods and no objects just straight instructions
* Now, go crazy on objects. 
  * Create a `Wall` class that holds instances of `Bottle` class. 
  * Maybe you subclass `Bottle` with `BeerBottle`?
  * Make sure that each object only has a single responsibility. For one thing, there should be no `puts` statements in the domain objects. There should be something like a `WallPrinter` class which takes a wall and prints out its current status.

### Reflection & Experimentation

* Which approach is easier to understand for this situation?
* Which approach is easier to test?
* Try changing each to represent "99 bottles of seltzer" instead of beer. Is one more difficult to change than the other?
* Try changing each to hold two counts, a number of bottles of beer and a number of bottles of selzer, simultaneously. The printer should output both. Is one programming approach easier to change than the other?

### Pairs
