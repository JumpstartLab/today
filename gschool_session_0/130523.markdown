## Peer Review

When you're not in the instructor reviews, gather in the groups below and explore your projects. Each of you should show off your own project and answer questions from the rest of the group. Consider topics such as:

* A quick tour of the functionality
* What parts of the user experience / design are you most proud of?
* What parts of the user experience / design need the most work?
* What are you proud of about the codebase? What goals were you pushing towards?
* What parts of the code are complex or hacky? In hindsight, could different design choices led to cleaner implementation?

In total, spend at least an hour together thinking, talking, and exploring the code.
