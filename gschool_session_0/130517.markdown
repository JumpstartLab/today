## Daily Outline

* 1-on-1s, Open Source, and YA Projects
* Guest: Clay Johnson

## Open Source & YA Work

Today let's get some great work done. Choose from the following:

### Open Source

* Have you found bugs or outstanding issues with one of the API gems you're using?
* Want to write warm-up exercises for our group?
* Solve one of the warm-up exercises using JavaScript, CoffeeScript, or Elixir and put together an explanatory blog post
* Write a tutorial about a technology you're working with or have had trouble with.
* Other ideas of your own :)

### YA Work

Our YA kids will be back on Monday. You should have a final draft site done that just needs small tweaks. I'll make the photos available this morning if you'd like to use them.

You can choose to work on this project today.

## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of this session (9:00-9:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

#### FeedEngine 

* What have been the tough parts so far? 
* What's the plan for the next six days? 
* What is it going to be like when you finish?

#### Boulder Startup Week

* What did you learn yesterday?
* Did it give you any better sense of what you want to do after our class? Why/what/how?
* Did it give you any new perspective on how you're going to attack our last weeks?

### Group Conversation
