## Daily Outline

* Project: Finishing EventReporter
* Project Evaluation: Peer Assessment
* Project Evaluation: Code Reviews & Peer Refactoring
* Lightning Talk: Check-Ins

## Finishing EventReporter

As you wrap things up, make sure you take one more look at how the code is going to actually be evaluated. You should know exactly how many points you'll earn even before you submit your solution.

### Maximizing Your Evaluation

Pull up the [EventReporter project description](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html) and go down to the "Evaluation Criteria". Did you remember to audit your code style? 

### Submitting Your Work

This week we'll use a Git/Github workflow to submit your work. Please complete this step *well before 11AM* so we can start peer evaluations on time.

1. Visit the [submission page for this project](https://github.com/gSchool/submissions/blob/master/projects/event_reporter.markdown)
2. Edit the line with your name, adding the Git Read-Only URL for your project
3. Save and submit your pull request

Pull requests will then be merged, creating one master document with everyone's repo URLs.

## EventReporter: Peer Assessment

At 11AM we'll begin peer assessment. It is not acceptable to be looking at or working on your own code after 11:00:00.

### Data Collection

Visit [http://eval.jumpstartlab.com](http://eval.jumpstartlab.com) and begin the "Peer Evaluation for EventManager" evaluation.

### Protocol

Your goal is to determine three scores for your peer, defined by the Evaluation Criteria in [the project assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html).

#### Correctness

Use the five "Evaluations for Base Expectations" scripts to determine correctness. If their program deviates from the expected results/output, that script fails.

#### Style

Since this project is just one file, it's not too difficult to evaluate style manually. Scan through their file looking for (A) lines that are over 80 characters long or (B) methods which are 13 or more lines long. Then determine the score based on the number of style violations.

#### Effort

This section may take some interpretation. If all the stories passed in correctness, then they'll earn at least a three. If more than one story failed, you need to determine whether it was one incorrect feature that popped up in multiple stories, or multiple features that were missing/incorrect.

Then you need to evaluate the extensions. Use the "Evaluations for Extensions" at the bottom of the project assignment. If the output matches exactly, the story passes. If it deviates, the story fails and the extension is not credited.

## Post-Project

We're going to split up into three groups.

1. Scored 11 or Higher - Code Review & Refactoring with Steve
2. Scored 7-10 - Paired Reviews with Katrina
3. Scored 6 or under - Starting Over with Jeff

### Code Review & Refactoring with Steve

Join Steve downstairs in the largest conference room for a group code review and refactoring.

### Paired Reviews with Katrina

Meet in the second classroom. You'll work in pairs to iron out the small kinks in your programs and get tips from
Katrina about structural / stylistic improvements.

### Starting Over with Jeff

Meet in the main classroom to pretend it's Monday and start this thing over.

## Lightning Talk Check-Ins

If you're delivering a lightning talk tomorrow, please meet Jeff in the second classroom at 3:30 to review your current content/plan.
