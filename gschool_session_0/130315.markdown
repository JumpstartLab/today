## Personal Study & Open Source

Use the time this afternoon to recouperate through learning. Please remember to **respect the Friday** and put in a solid effort.

### New Study Ideas

* I heard you like Scrabble. Could you implement a Scrabble game that tracks multiple players, multiple scores, validates the words against a dictionary, and can print out a board? What would go into it? You can't write the game in this short of a time, but you can start sketching out the objects and ideas.

### Old Ideas

* Install Ruby 2.0 via RVM. 
  * Run some of your old code, like SalesEngine or warmups. Do things work as expected? Faster/slower?
  * Experiment with some of the new features explained in https://speakerdeck.com/shyouhei/whats-new-in-ruby-2-dot-0 and http://globaldev.co.uk/2012/11/ruby-2-0-0-preview-features/
* Read about and practice writing Rake tasks: http://jasonseifer.com/2010/04/06/rake-tutorial
  * Experimenting with writing a rake task to automate some part of your system or workflow. Could you write a rake task that deletes files in your `Downloads` folder that are older than 15 days?
* Use RSpec to review your Ruby with TestFirst.org: http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby
* Work through the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
* Start experimenting with the JavaScript lessons on http://www.codecademy.com/
