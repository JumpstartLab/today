## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Spend 35 minutes writing a blog post reflecting on some of the questions below.

* Now that you've had exposure to more companies, through interviews, shadowing, and guest speakers, how has it refined what you're looking for? Do you feel that you'll be able to pick a perfect fit, or will you have to take something that seems "good enough"?
* What are you looking to learn or master over our remaining weeks? As people (including you) are more and more distracted with the job hunt, will that be possible? What techniques and strategies will you use to manage your time and goals? Are there any ways that the job hunt is pushing you to "learn harder"?
* In these last weeks, what are the things you most need from us as an instructional team? Are there any gaps you're looking to fill? Technologies you want to touch?
