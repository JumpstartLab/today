## Daily Outline

* Warm-up
* Integration Strategy
* Integrating with Instagram

## Integration Strategy

* Integrations are a virus
* Contain naming and interaction
* Testing an external service
* VCR is a stub
* Offline tests

## Integrating with Instagram

For this exercise you should:

* Get together with your pair listed below
* Build a small Rails application from scratch
* Follow a normal TDD/BDD process including acceptance tests
* Use VCR to stub out the remote service

### Pairs

* Kareem Grant & Erin Drummond
* Geoffrey Schorkopf & Christopher Knight
* Paul Blackwell & Jorge Tellez
* Shane Rogers & Logan Sears
* Jennifer Eliuk & Bradley Sheehan
* Aimee Maher & Daniel Mee
* Chelsea Komlo & Kyle Suss
* John Maddux & Elaine Tai
* James Denman & Josh Mejia
* Raphael Weiner & Phil Battos
* Danny Garcia & Blair Anderson & Laura Steadman

### User Stories

Here's what we're looking for in the application:

```
As a public, non-authenticated user
When I visit '/'
And I enter a valid username like "johnkeatley"
Then I see the most recent Instagram photo from that user
```
