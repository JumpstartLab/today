## Project Work

When you're not doing your skills assessment, continue working on TrafficSpy.

## Skills Assessment

You can find the assessment assignment at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/scrabble.html

Before your session you **should**:

* Read the assignment
* Clone the repo: https://github.com/gSchool/scrabble
* Run `bundler` to install dependencies
* Ask classmates over Flowdock if there are details you don't understand *about the assignment*, not the implementation
* Get to your room a few minutes early
* Make sure you mind is in the right state to show off your capabilities

Before your session you **should not**:

* Begin working on the assignment
* Discuss how to implement the assignment
* Freak out. It's not that serious!
