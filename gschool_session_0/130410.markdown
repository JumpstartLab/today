## Follow Up: Performance of Code & Queries

Katrina will answer a few questions and perform a quick review of the
topics she introduced yesterday.

## Class: Multi-Tenancy

Frank is going to walk through converting blogger from a single blog to a multiple blog platform.

To follow along with this instruction you clone the project:

{% terminal %}
$ git clone git://github.com/gsbhool/rails-testing.git multi-tenant-blogger
$ cd multi-tenant-blogger
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rake db:setup
{% endterminal %}

A rough draft of notes can be found [here]({% page_url topics/multi-tenant-applications %}).

The finished product can be found on the [multi-tenant-finished](https://github.com/gSchool/rails-testing/tree/multi-tenant-finished) branch.

{% terminal %}
$ git checkout multi-tenant-finished
{% endterminal %}

## Project Work

Remember the amount of work for this project is great with a short timeline.

You have a meeting tomorrow afternoon with your Customers to check in
on the stories that you have started, finished, and created.
