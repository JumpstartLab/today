## FeedEngine: Controllers, Tests, and Refactoring

This morning let's experiment with some testing and refactoring techniques specifically focusing on Controllers.

We'll use HaxHub as our base for experimentation:

* [HaxHub Source Code](https://github.com/blairand/alpha-feed-engine)
* [AuthenticationController](https://github.com/blairand/alpha-feed-engine/blob/master/app/controllers/authentication_controller.rb)

### Controller Spec Notes

* Using Guard
* [RSpec Controller Specs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/controller-specs)
* `get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`
* `render_template`
* `redirect_to`
* `assigns`

## Reading: Paul Dix's Service-Oriented Design

* Purchase Paul Dix's [Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321659368/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321659368&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)
* Use this hour to make progress on reading
