## Daily Outline

* Warm-Up
* Class: Just Enough Agile
* Class: Introducing SalesEngine
* Class: Introduction to Pivotal Tracker
* Project Work: Planning Sales Engine

## Warm-Up

Go to github, fork the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository, and tweak the remotes so that yours is the `origin`, and the JumpstartLab is `upstream`.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/your/warmup-exercises
git remote rm origin
git remote add upstream git://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises.git
git remote add origin <your-fork>
```

Add the link to the github page of your fork [in the submissions repository](https://github.com/gSchool/submissions/blob/master/projects/warmup_exercises.markdown).

At 8:50 we will release a new warm-up exercise to the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository.

```sh
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
```

to get the assignment. You have until 9:15 to complete your program.

At 9:15 `git commit` your code and `git pull --rebase upstream master` to get the tests, and run the tests against your program.

When you're done, `git push origin master` to push to your fork.

## Just Enough Agile

Projects are more likely to fail because of people problems than technical problems, and people problems often stem from poor organization. Both in our projects and in the real world, organizing your work is essential to success.

Let's talk about the basics of the agile methodology and how it'll apply to our work.

### Waterfall Development

* Gather and agree upon complete requirements
* Design the components of the system with their interactions/interfaces
* Implement the design
* Verify that the implementation realizes the requirements
* Maintain the software as necessary

### Agile Development

It's complicated.

#### Agile Principles by Kent Beck

* Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
* Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
* Working software is the principal measure of progress
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Close, daily co-operation between business people and developers
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity is essential
* Self-organizing teams
* Regular adaptation to changing circumstances

#### Scrum Development

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)
* Key components:
  * iterations & sprints
  * backlog
  * meetings & standups

### (User) Stories

* Stories are our "to-do" items
* "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"
* Focus on the value delivered
* Gherkin language is one option:

```
 Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
   In order to realize a named business value
   As an explicit system actor
   I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal
  
   Scenario: Some determinable business situation
     Given some precondition
       And some other precondition
      When some action by the actor
       And some other action
      Then some testable outcome is achieved
       And something else we can check happens too
```

## Introducing SalesEngine
